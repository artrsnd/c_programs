##C Programs

This repository is a collection of C programs written by me. It is organized by these categories:

- Data Structure
- Sort Algorithms
- Misc

### Data Structure

This directory has some data structure algorithms.

The most .c files can not be used simultaneosly because some structures are the same, e.g. node_t and data_t, used in linked-lists, stack and queue files. The only way to make everything work is to rename the structures in each file.

In none of the implementations is the descriptive data type used and, in the case of the lists, there is no insertion order. This is made only in the tail of the list.

### Misc

- Monte Carlo: Algorithms to calculate Pi value with Monte Carlo Technique with multi threads and mutual exclusion semaphore. **Work only on unix systems and this codes are written in pt-br.**
